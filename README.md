# Materialise
Ever wanted to use the Materialize library, but not make it apply to the entire page? Materialise is a customised version of the Materialize library that allows you to only apply it to elements wrapped in a div with the "materialise" class.

All you need to get started is reference the CSS and JavaScript file in your HTML document. The JavaScript file comes included with an isolated version of jQuery, meaning that you're free to use other JavaScript libraries in your document that would overwise cause conflicts.
